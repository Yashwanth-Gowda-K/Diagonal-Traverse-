## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to control direction flow (`up-right` â†” `down-left`) in a matrix.
- Managing edge cases: hitting top, bottom, left, or right borders.
- Efficient looping through all matrix elements using a single pass.
- Clean use of conditionals to handle matrix traversal logic.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

- Matrix boundary detection
- Conditional direction change
- One-pass iteration
- Clean control flow using a direction flag

## ðŸ§ª Example

### Input:

```python
mat = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
